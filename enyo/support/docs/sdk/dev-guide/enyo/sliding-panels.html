      Sliding Panels
    </h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> As of Enyo version 0.8, the <code>SlidingGroup</code> and <code>Sliding</code> controls have been deprecated in favor of <code>SlidingPane</code> and <code>SlidingView</code>, respectively.
    </p>
    <h2 id="slidingpane">
      SlidingPane
    </h2>
    <p>
      A <code>SlidingPane</code> is a control designed to present a horizontal layout of <code>SlidingView</code> controls, which are panel controls that can slide one on top of another. The user can drag the views left and right and they'll stay connected. If a view is moved to the far left, it will cover any views to the left of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SlidingViews can have explicit width or be flexed. In either case, they are displayed in a SlidingPane's client region, which is an <code>HFlexBox</code>. The view on the far right is special -- it will always behave as flexed unless its <code>fixedWidth</code> property is set to <code>true</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>SlidingPane</code> exposes the same selection methods as <code>Pane</code>. The selected view is the one displayed at the far left of the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>SlidingPane</code> also has two layout modes -- the normal layout, in which views are placed left-to-right, and a narrow layout, in which views are stacked, taking up the entire width of the SlidingPane. A SlidingPane can automatically toggle between these layouts if its <code>resize</code> method is hooked up to respond to window resizing. The <code>&quot;wideWidth&quot;</code> property has a default value of 500 and is the pivot point between the two layouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's an example:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<code>{kind: &quot;SlidingPane&quot;, flex: 1, components: [
  {name: &quot;left&quot;, width: &quot;320px&quot;},
  {name: &quot;middle&quot;, width: &quot;320px&quot;, peekWidth: 68},
  {name: &quot;right&quot;, flex: 1, onResize: &quot;slidingResize&quot;}
]}
</code>
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="slidingview">
      SlidingView
    </h2>
    <p>
      A <code>SlidingView</code> is a view that slides back and forth and is designed to be a part of a <code>SlidingPane</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      SlidingView objects have a <code>&quot;dragAnywhere&quot;</code> property, whose default value is <code>true</code>. This allows the user to drag the view from any point inside the panel that is not already a draggable region (e.g., a <code>Scroller</code>). If <code>dragAnywhere</code> is set to <code>false</code>, then the view can still be dragged via any control inside it whose <code>&quot;slidingHandler&quot;</code> property is set to <code>true</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>&quot;peekWidth&quot;</code> property specifies the amount the pane view should be offset from the left when it is selected. This allows controls on the underlying view object to the left of the selected one to be partially revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>SlidingView</code> has some other published properties that are less frequently used. The <code>&quot;minWidth&quot;</code> property specifies a minimum width for view content, and <code>&quot;edgeDragging&quot;</code> lets the user drag the view from its left edge. (The default value of <code>edgeDragging</code> is <code>false</code>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The last view in a SlidingPane is special -- it is resized to fit the available space. The <code>onResize</code> event is fired when this occurs.
    </p>
