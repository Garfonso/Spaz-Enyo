      Release Notes - webOS SDK 3.0 Beta 1
    </h1>
    <p>
      webOS 3.0 SDK Beta 1 is a major update, providing developers with a wealth of new features across the software platform, detailed below.
    </p>
    <h2 id="tools-and-installers">
      Tools and Installers
    </h2>
    <h3 id="palm-package">
      palm-package
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the 3.0 SDK, the <code>palm-package</code> tool has been updated to properly package Enyo apps so they can be installed onto the Palm Emulator (using <code>palm-install</code>) and launched (using <code>palm-launch</code> or the webOS application launcher).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not necessary to include a copy of the Enyo framework inside the application, nor is it necessary to modify the script tag that includes <code>&quot;enyo.js&quot;</code>, since <code>palm-package</code> will re-write this (to work in the emulator or device) when it builds the application package, as long as the script tag ends with <code>&quot;0.8/framework/enyo.js&quot;</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that you can develop on the desktop using a relative (or absolute) path to the Enyo framework, and <code>palm-package</code> will update the tag when it creates the package.
    </p>
    <h2 id="enyo-framework">
      Enyo Framework
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Enyo framework has been updated from version 0.6 to 0.8.
    </p>
    <h3 id="gestures-and-events">
      Gestures and Events
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          This should be a transparent change, but the way in which mouse events are handled has changed considerably. This should provide for better handling of clicks across element boundaries, and it provides basic drag and drop handling.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              New standard Enyo events for: <code>ondragstart</code>, <code>ondrag</code>, <code>ondragfinish</code> (fire on the control that is being dragged).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              New standard Enyo events for: <code>ondragover</code>, <code>ondragout</code>, <code>ondrop</code> (fire on the control that is being dragged over).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          See <code>support/examples/Drag</code> for examples.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It is now possible to prevent focus changes by implementing <code>onmousedown</code> and calling <code>inEvent.preventDefault()</code>. This can be used to prevent the virtual keyboard from hiding.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Users of the DOM attribute <code>&quot;enyo-pass-events&quot;</code> should be aware that it has been removed in favor of an explicit control flag, <code>&quot;requiresDomMousedown&quot;</code>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Removed 100ms delay in processing click event.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="cross-app-ui">
      Cross-App UI
    </h3>
    <p>
      An <code>enyo.CrossAppUI</code> component has been added to allow x-app content. The content is displayed inside an <code>&lt;IFRAME&gt;</code> and applications are responsible for sizing and positioning the UI. The app property specifies the id of the app to get content from; path is the HTML document in that app to use; and params are the data to send to the app. The <code>onResult</code> event fires when the x-app content sends a result to your application.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<code>{kind: &quot;CrossAppUI&quot;, params:{url:&quot;http://www.palm.com&quot;}, app:&quot;com.palm.app.enyo-browser&quot;,
  path: &quot;index.html&quot;, onResult: &quot;handleResult&quot;}
</code>
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The <code>enyo.CrossAppResult</code> component can be used to send a result from the x-app content back to the host application.
    </p>
    <h3 id="globalization-g11n-and-internationalization-i18n">
      Globalization (g11n) and Internationalization (i18n)
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Globalization library &quot;g11n&quot; is now part of Enyo.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they are now handled by g11n, <code>enyo.Date</code>, <code>enyo.addOnStart</code>, and <code>enyo.getLocale</code> have been removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core of g11n is automatically built into Enyo; however the address, name, and phone number submodules must be loaded separately. This can be done with the following code:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<code>enyo.depends(
  &quot;$enyo/g11n/name/&quot;,
  &quot;$enyo/g11n/address/&quot;,
  &quot;$enyo/g11n/phone/&quot;
);
</code>
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <h3 id="ui-controls">
      UI Controls
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>SlidingGroup</code> is officially deprecated in favor of <code>SlidingPane</code>, a proper <code>Pane</code> kind.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>SlidingPane</code> supports the same API as <code>Pane</code>, so instead of <code>setSelected</code> and <code>getSelected</code>, use <code>selectView</code> and <code>getView</code>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>SlidingPane</code> should contain <code>SlidingView</code> controls (<code>SlidingView</code> replaces <code>Sliding</code>); <code>SlidingView</code> is the defaultKind of <code>SlidingPane</code>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>SlidingPane</code> replaces the <code>&quot;wideLayout&quot;</code> with <code>&quot;multiView&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;wideWidth&quot;</code> with <code>&quot;multiViewMinWidth&quot;</code>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The animation has been redone to use JavaScript instead of CSS, but the change should be mostly transparent. For example, it's possible to specify a custom easing function for the animation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Popups should now reposition themselves when the window is resized.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="windows">
      Windows
    </h3>
    <p>
      <code>enyo.window.setWindowParams()</code> is now an asynchronous call, and the params are limited to valid JSON structures (no cycles on the object graph, no functions, and so on).
    </p>
    <h3 id="webviews">
      WebViews
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Added padding around smart zoom rect.
      </li>
      <li>Keep user pan/zoom during load.
      </li>
      <li>Respect min/max zoom from meta tag.
      </li>
      <li>Set default layout width to 1024.
      </li>
      <li>Disable pinchzoom by meta tag.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="new-folder-structure">
      New Folder Structure
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Enyo folder structure has been changed. This should be mostly transparent to apps, with the following exceptions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>enyo.js</code> is now in the <code>0.8/framework</code> folder. Please update the script path, e.g.,
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
<code>&lt;script src=&quot;../../enyo/0.8/framework/enyo.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In depends files, update loading of theme packages to use the <code>$palm</code> alias rather than <code>$enyo</code>, e.g.,
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
<code>&quot;$palm/themes/Gemstone-default/&quot;,
</code>
</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="api-changes">
      API Changes
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Removed <code>enyo.dom.fetchNodeOffset</code>. Replaced with a simplified <code>enyo.dom.calcNodeOffset</code>, which is protected and calculates offset using only offsetTop/Left and does not adjust for webkitTransform or scroll position.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In <code>enyo.ManagedDomBuilder</code>, added public method <code>getOffset</code>, which calculates control offset and adjusts for any offset that controls specify (e.g., la webkitTransform, scroll position).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>openNearNode(inNode, inOffset)</code> has been removed; instead, use <code>openAtControl(inControl, inOffset)</code>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>openAroundNode(inNode)</code> has been removed; instead, use <code>openAroundControl(inControl)</code>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The API has been adjusted to no longer use <code>l</code>, <code>t</code>, <code>r</code>, and <code>b</code> properties. Instead, <code>left</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>bottom</code> are used. For example, in <code>openAt(inRect)</code>, <code>inRect</code> may contain <code>left</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, or <code>bottom</code> properties.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Added code to preserve max-height/width sizes set by the user; note that we set max height/width to ensure popup is not larger than the viewport.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Added <code>enyo.fetchAppRootPath</code>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Added string util for escaping and removing HTML.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      New Hardware
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are additional hardware identifiers that can be returned by:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<code>#define HARDWARE_VEER       301
#define HARDWARE_PRE_2      401
#define HARDWARE_PRE_3      501
#define HARDWARE_TOUCHPAD   601
</code>
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <h3 id="virtual-keyboard">
      Virtual Keyboard
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<code>PDL_Err PDL_SetKeyboardState(PDL_bool bVisible);
</code>
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      If your application takes keyboard input, you need to be aware that with the HP Touchpad, we're starting to produce devices that do not have a physical keyboard. On these systems, you use <code>PDL_SetKeyboardState</code> to turn the on-screen keyboard on and off. When on-screen, the keyboard will send keyup/down SDL events. The keyboard can be dismissed by the user, so you should either provide a way for the user to toggle the keyboard on/off or always enable it when your app wants keyboard input.
    </p>
    <h3 id="compass">
      Compass
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<code>typedef struct
{
  int confidence;
  double magneticBearing;
  double trueBearing;
} PDL_Compass; 

PDL_Err PDL_EnableCompass(PDL_bool activate);
PDL_Err PDL_GetCompass(PDL_Compass *compass);
</code>
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      These APIs are for devices that include a compass sensor, like the HP Pre 3. Since the compass uses power, you should only enable it when it is needed. When it's turned on, you can either poll for its current setting using <code>PDL_GetCompass</code> or wait for <code>PDL_COMPASS</code> events to be sent through the SDL event loop.
    </p>
    <h3 id="emulator">
      Emulator
    </h3>
    <p>
      Starting with the webOS 3.0 emulator, you are able to run x86-compiled PDK code in either full-screen or hybrid mode. Code using the SDL APIs is supported, but OpenGL ES is not yet functional in emulation. You need a separate x86 toolchain to build PDK code. On Windows, you can download the current CodeSourcery G++ Lite cross-compiler from <a href="http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/ia32/portal/release1567">http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/ia32/portal/release1567</a>. We have seen problems with these tools when hosted on 64-bit Windows.

          If you are installing and using VirtualBox for the very first time, please launch the VirtualBox application first before starting the Palm Emulator. Or, if you have already tried to start the Palm Emulator and found that it won't start, type the following command from a command shell:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
<code>VBoxManage setextradata global &quot;GUI/UpdateDate&quot; &quot;never&quot;

        <p>
          When installing an application into the 3.0.0.611 Palm Emulator with <code>palm-install</code>, the application's icon may not appear in the launcher until the system manager (or emulator) is restarted. The app can still be launched immediately with <code>palm-launch</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To restart the system manager, type the following in a host command shell:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
<code>novacom run file:///sbin/stop LunaSysMgr &amp;&amp; novacom run file:///sbin/start LunaSysMgr

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>ExhibitionMode</strong> -- When putting the emulator into Exhibition Mode and selecting this sample, the emulator will crash. This is not an issue on the device and is under investigation. Also occurs in the Mojo version of this app.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>JustType</strong> -- To add this sample to the Just Type list you'll need to select it in the preferences of the OS's Just Type app. You can get there by typing from anywhere outside a running app to bring up the Just Type app, then open its app menu in the top left of the screen and select Preferences. The dbsearch capability does not appear to be an option on the emulator and needs investigation. This sample will not provide database functionality on a desktop browser since there is no mock data being provided.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Media</strong> -- Audio and video playback are not supported in the emulator. The emulator does not have a video application currently, so the examples of launching the video app will do nothing on the emulator. This sample does not currently demonstrate how to interrupt media playback on interrupt events; that is coming in a future update. This sample will run in a desktop browser, however the audio and video app launching features will not work and the audio object example will not work unless you change the referenced audio file to one that is relative to the app on the desktop (i.e., not an audio file on the device).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>simpleWebViewSample</strong> -- This sample fails on the emulator but works in the desktop browser. Currently under investigation. This needs investigation but appears to be a general issue with Enyo's WebView implementation in version 0.8.
