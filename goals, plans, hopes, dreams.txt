[] = tentative assigned person.

popout = tweetview/profileview
column = column with list of tweets
panel = accounts or timeline

Goals for 3.0
- Gapless Tweets: always get the # of tweets needed to get up to date. no set limit [Funkatron?]
- Use Accounts panel to add/remove columns. [Tibfib]
	- Custom Searches (also, allow more than one search per column!) [Tibfib + Funkatron]
- Allow users to clear seen tweets
- tapping search button brings up popout, from there people can decide if they want to save the search as a column [Tibfib]
- Compose ... what to do, options: 
	- make long landscape panel below columns.
	- Have a dialog in middle of screen. scrim over other elements
	- make popout
